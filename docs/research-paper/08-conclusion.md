# 7. Conclusion

Resume Intelligence demonstrates that hybridizing deterministic ATS scoring with Gemini-driven qualitative analysis can deliver transparent, user-centric resume diagnostics. The platform empowers applicants to iteratively refine materials using measurable feedback, persistent configuration options, and rich visualizations. FastAPI, React, and MongoDB provided a flexible foundation for rapid experimentation and extension.

The project underscores the importance of grounding generative AI insights in structured evidence, balancing innovation with reliability. By enforcing explicit mode selection and preserving audit trails of analysis inputs, the system enhances user trust while maintaining adaptability to changing job market demands.

# Abstract

Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) play a decisive role in modern recruitment pipelines, yet applicants frequently struggle to understand why resumes fail automated screening. This project, Resume Intelligence, delivers a full-stack platform that combines traditional natural language processing with Google Gemini Pro reasoning to provide transparent resume diagnostics and actionable recommendations. The system ingests multi-format resumes, extracts structured features, evaluates ATS compatibility, and visualizes strengths and weaknesses through an interactive dashboard. By unifying resume parsing, AI-assisted scoring, and persistent personalization settings, the platform empowers candidates to iteratively improve application materials and quantify their readiness for specific job descriptions.

Key contributions include: (1) an extensible FastAPI-based microservice that orchestrates parsing, masking, and AI inference workflows; (2) a React and Tailwind-powered analytical workspace that surfaces resume intelligence in real time; and (3) a MongoDB-backed persistence layer that tracks analyses, user preferences, and ontology curation. Experimental usage demonstrates that blending rule-based scoring with generative feedback enhances user comprehension of ATS criteria, promoting evidence-driven resume refinement.
